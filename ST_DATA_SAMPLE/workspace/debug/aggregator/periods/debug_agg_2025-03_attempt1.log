Anxiety (withdrawal aspect 0.75) was metabolised via mature cognitive reappraisal rather than impulsive volatility, allowing assertive leadership when technical authority was required.  Values of security and achievement eclipsed power or conformity, supporting a Hero-Sage archetypal constellation.  The snapshot reveals a person whose psychological centre of gravity is truth-through-competence; growth edges include recognising the social cost of moral absolutism and expanding openness to experience beyond problem-solving intellect."}
