relentless quest to understand magical phenomena, while pronounced compassion translates insight into protective action. The youth defers to mentor authority yet confidently questions procedural ethics, revealing an agreeable backbone rather than submission. Anxiety clusters around competence, not social threat; emotional regulation relies on intellectual framing and altruistic purpose. Defense style is mature (intellectualization, sublimation) and relationship stance is secure, suggesting prior experiences of safe mentorship. No within-session drift is detectable; the profile functions as a stable baseline against which future growth arcs—particularly the integration of assertiveness and the modulation of self-criticism—can be tracked."}
