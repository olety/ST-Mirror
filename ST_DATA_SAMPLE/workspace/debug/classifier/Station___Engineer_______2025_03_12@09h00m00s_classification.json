The panic wants to rise but I push it down - that won't help anyone.* \"On my way. Can you give me preliminary data? \n3.

The primary scrubbers are offline, backup systems are compensating but they're at 140% capacity. We ha\n4.

Deeper level: this is my\n5. [USER/Alex]: *The request lands heavy - lead the team? Me? Two months of experience versus Torres's fifteen years.

I know these systems.* \"I need direct access to the primary scrubber telemetry for the past 72 \n8. [AI/Engineer Martinez]: *A stocky woman with graying hair drifts over, already in her EVA prep suit.* \"Solid approach. I've seen too many rookies pretend they know everything and get people killed.\" *She pulls up the backup \n9.

They all went offline within a 90-second window, which suggests either a commo\n10. [USER/Alex]: *After receiving operational authority, I take a moment to center myself.

This is detective work - finding patterns in noise, inferring cause from effect. The l\n12. [AI/Engineer Martinez]: *She nods approvingly.* \"Common cause failure - smart thinking. Chen, you heard the man. We're checking power distribution first, then individual scrubber diagnostics if that's clean.\" *She activates \n13. [USER/Alex]: *I feel a small surge of confidence - she called my thinking smart, she's following my diagnostic plan. But I also feel the weight of responsibility. If I'm wrong about the power node, we're wasting p\n14.

On whose authorization? You're barely two mont\n15.

I have the most current oxygen system certification o\n16. [USER/Alex]: *I'm surprised. I expected pushback, threats, termination. Not... acceptance.* \"They're accepting the report? All of it? Including the findings about cost-cutting decisions leading to the failure?\"\n17. [AI/Janice Holloway]: *She speaks for the first time, crisp and professional.* \"Corporate determined that the cost of addressing the safety issues now is lower than the cost of potential lawsuits if there's a loss-of-life \n18. [USER/Alex]: *I process this. Not because they care about safety inherently, but because the financial calculus favored compliance. It's cynical, but it's also... a win? People will be safer.

That's your job.\" *He pauses.* \"Corporate wants me to tell you they appreciate engineers who prioritize safety. They've al\n20. [USER/Alex]: *Project lead. That's... a promotion, effectively. Not only am I not being punished, I'm being rewarded. The world is strange sometimes.* \"I'll do it. And I'll document it accurately. Same as always.\"\n21. [AI/Station Manager Reeves]: *He nods slowly.* \"I get it. And for what it's worth, you did good work yesterday. Kept people alive. That's what matters.\" *He extends his hand.* \"We're good. Let's move forward.\"\n22. [USER/Alex]: *I shake his hand, recognizing this is as close to an apology as I'll get. Good enough. The conflict is resolved, the safety issues are being fixed, and I still have my job. Better outcome than I expe\n23.

But grateful for the opportunity to test myself and discover I'm more capable \n28. [AI/Engineer Chen]: *He looks relieved.* \"Still. You handled the whole crisis really well. I've been on station for six months and I would have panicked in that situation. You stayed calm, made decisions, asked for input\n29.
