Leadership as coordination rather than control - I don't need to have all the answers. I need to help the team use their expertise effectively.\n\n3. Appropriate boundary-setting - I said no to Council Leader Voss about Silvershore. Old me would have agonized or caved. New me felt clear.\n\n4. Emotional regulation under pressure - When the underground reservoir destabilized, I was scared but functional. Fear became information instead of paralysis.\n\n5. Connection without anxiety - Kira. The old me would have either been too anxious to acknowledge attraction or would have obsessed over it destructively. New me can say \"yes, I'm interested\" and \"not until the crisis is over\" in the same breath. That's secure attachment in action.\n\n6. Accepting praise - When people said I did good work, I said thank you instead of deflecting. Small thing, huge shift.'\n\n*I pause, rereading what I've written.
