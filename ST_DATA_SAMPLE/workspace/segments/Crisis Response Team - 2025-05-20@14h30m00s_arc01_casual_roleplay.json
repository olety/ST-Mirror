I hesitate, then add: 'I think I'm actually ready. Not perfectly, but genuinely.' Sending that message feels significant - acknowledging capability without the usual caveat of self-doubt.

The ceiling was water-stained, the mattress lumpy, but it was close to the crisis zone and that's what mattered. For a long moment, lying in the dim pre-dawn light, the weight of the impending assignment pressed down. Three hundred exposed workers. Unknown environmental contamination. Experimental hybrid reactor failure. This was leagues beyond anything tackled during apprenticeship work with Magistra Elara. The old anxiety tried to spiral: 'What if you're not ready? What if you fail? What if people die because you weren't good enough?' But something new rose to meet it - not false confidence, but grounded self-trust. 'You have the training. You have the skills. You can ask for help when you need it. You'll figure it out as you go.' The anxiety didn't disappear, but it became manageable. Background noise rather than overwhelming static.*"
