  "thinking": "10 decisions across 2 chunks = medium confidence overall. Key patterns: 1) Consistent ethical prioritization over political/economic pressure (5/10 decisions), 2) Adaptive, collaborative leadership (delegates, seeks expertise, shares credit), 3) High openness to novel solutions (modular protocol, synchronized spell), 4) Strong emotional regulation (acknowledges fear\u2192acts, uses rituals), 5) Values-driven choices always align with human welfare/truth. No impulsive or self-promoting decisions. Low neuroticism despite high-stakes; anxiety spikes are brief and channelled. Extraversion moderate: leads when needed but not dominance-seeking; warmth expressed in intimate dyad. Conscientiousness very high: preparation, documentation, systematic thinking. Openness high: abstract pharmaceutical analogy, accepts revolutionary findings. Agreeableness high-compassion, medium-politeness (will confront when ethics demand). Attachment: secure-autonomous; comfortable with vulnerability, sets boundaries, equal intimacy. Schwartz: Benevolence/Universalism dominate, followed by Self-Direction/Achievement; Power/Hedonism lowest. Archetypes: Sage-Hero-Caregiver triad. Defense: mature (sublimation, anticipation).",
