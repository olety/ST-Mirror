Total decisions = 10, so every weight is 1.0. I will preserve all aspect scores and evidence verbatim, note the lack of temporal data, and write a brief clinical summary that acknowledges the limited sample size while highlighting the coherent pattern that did emerge.",

Every choice prioritized human welfare over political or economic pressure, while novel problems were met with structured, modular solutions. Attachment security allowed vulnerability to be voiced without avoidance or reassurance-seeking, and affect was regulated through preparation rituals and immediate action. The profile is notable for the absence of self-promoting or pleasure-seeking impulses and for consistent use of mature defenses (sublimation, anticipation). Limited to ten decisions, the data yield a medium-confidence snapshot rather than a trajectory, yet internal consistency suggests these traits are centrally characteristic when the individual is operating under acute professional responsibility."
