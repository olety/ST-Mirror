  "thinking": "This is a multi-period longitudinal case spanning 5 months (Jan-May 2025) with four single-session snapshots.  Total decisions = 5 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 25.  Evidence distribution is heavily skewed toward the May session (10 decisions) and April session (5 decisions), with Jan and Mar contributing 5 each.  Recency weighting: Jan & Mar are oldest 1/3 (0.5\u00d7), Apr is middle 1/3 (1.0\u00d7), May is recent 1/3 (2.0\u00d7).  Evidence weights: Jan=5/25=0.2, Mar=5/25=0.2, Apr=5/25=0.2, May=10/25=0.4.  Final weights: Jan=0.5\u00d70.2=0.10, Mar=0.5\u00d70.2=0.10, Apr=1.0\u00d70.2=0.20, May=2.0\u00d70.4=0.80.  Total effective weight = 1.20.  Confidence will be calibrated to 25 decisions \u2192 medium overall, with lower confidence for values/archetypes where evidence is sparse.\n\nCurrent-state calculation example for Openness:\n(0.85\u00d70.10 + 0.55\u00d70.10 + 0.72\u00d70.20 + 0.87\u00d70.80) / 1.20 = 0.78\n\nAspect-level openness:\nIntellect: (0.90\u00d70.10 + 0.70\u00d70.10 + 0.85\u00d70.20 + 0.91\u00d70.80) / 1.20 = 0.86\nExperience: (0.80\u00d70.10 + 0.35\u00d70.10 + 0.45\u00d70.20 + 0.82\u00d70.80) / 1.20 = 0.68\n\nEvolution trajectory: compare earliest (Jan) to most recent (May).  Openness shows clear upward trend (0.85\u21920.87), but aspect analysis reveals Intellect stable (0.90\u21920.91) while Experience increased (0.80\u21920.82).  Conscientiousness shows remarkable consistency across all periods (0.70\u21920.92 aspect-weighted), indicating this is a core stable trait.  Neuroticism shows healing trajectory (0.60\u21920.28) with withdrawal aspect decreasing (0.80\u21920.33).  Attachment security strengthens over time (anxiety 0.35\u21920.24).  Values show increasing universalism (0.75\u21920.91) and benevolence (0.90\u21920.93), with decreasing conformity (0.50\u21920.48) and tradition (0.40\u21920.25).\n\nMeta-patterns: Conscientiousness aspects (industriousness & orderliness) are universally high across all periods (<0.15 variance), defining core identity.  Compassion is consistently high (0.82-0.95) while politeness varies (0.25-0.75), indicating authentic care without deference to authority.  Intellectual openness is stable (0.85-0.91) while experiential openness grows (0.35-0.82), suggesting expanding comfort with novelty.  Defense mechanisms mature across all periods (sublimation, altruism, anticipation).  Shadow needs analysis reveals consistent exploration of moral courage under pressure, with fantasy scenarios repeatedly testing ethical boundaries and competence under crisis.\n\nGrowth narrative: trajectory from anxious apprentice (Jan) to confident crisis-leader (May), with increasing capacity for public vulnerability, systematic innovation, and ethical assertiveness.  Key integration: learning to channel anxiety into structured action while maintaining compassion and intellectual rigor.",
